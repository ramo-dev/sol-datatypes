This repository demonstrates the basic data types available in Solidity using simple smart contracts.

## Contracts

- **Conditionals.sol:** This contract illustrates how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to control program flow based on conditions.

- **Counter.sol:** This contract showcases the `uint` (unsigned integer) data type and how to increment it. It's a simple counter that can be incremented by calling the `increment()` function.

- **Mappings.sol:** This contract demonstrates the use of mappings in Solidity. Mappings are key-value stores that allow you to retrieve values based on their associated keys.

- **Structs.sol:** This contract introduces structs, which are custom data structures that allow you to group together variables of different types under a single name.
